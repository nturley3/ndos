nDOS
====
nDOS is a DOSBox port for iOS and iPadOS, allowing you to run old MS-DOS games and programs. nDOS is forked from the original iDOS/DOSPad project but updated to use the latest code from the DOSBox SVN source tree. It also contains additional patches and customizations. 

Purpose
====
I'm a fan of retro gaming, especially from the MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 era. I'm also a fan of Apple products, especially the iPad. Being able to play old DOS/Windows games on a touchscreen device like an iPad brings old memories back to life using modern gear. 

I also wanted to take on a coding project that would be fun while learning about the Apple SDKs and developing in the iOS ecosystem (even if the project is using an older Objective-C base).

Patches/Customizations
====
* Latest DOSBox SVN source revisions merged from the community
* Updates to the code to utilize non-deprecated functions and methods. Eliminates deprecated iOS warnings for the original dospad code. Does not fix DOSBox source warnings.
* UI tweaks for improved experience with some games (e.g. Civilization 1).
* IMGMAKE patch allowing creation of floppy and harddisk images within DosBox. This is a convenience feature for creating images to organize software packages or install other retro operating systems under DOSBox (e.g. DOS 6.22, Windows 2.03). Reference: [imgmake](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=19349)
* Patched to support max memory of 383MB. This can be used for running Win9x (although not tested)
* Apple Pencil gesture support
* Additional DOS support commands (such as XCOPY, DOSIDLE, MEM etc). See branch `vfile-additions` for more information.
* Updated pagefault handling for normal core. Disables pagefault recursion to enable better support for running Windows 95. See [Vogons discussion](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=36629)
